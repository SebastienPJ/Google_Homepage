# Google_Homepage

Here is my solution to the Google Homepage clone challenge fron The Odin project.

I used HTML and CSS to complete this project.

Also, this was my first time laying things out with flexbox.

Topics learned and reinforced:
- Flexbox properties (flex container, flex items, flex-direction, justify-content, align-items)
- Hover effects
- Starting to use more Semantic elements
- CSS organization


Thank you to The Odin Project for a challenging experience. I am excited as to what lays ahead!
